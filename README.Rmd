# pivta

`pivta` is an R wrapper of the [WebDataRocks](https://www.webdatarocks.com/). The package allows to work with an interactive pivot table among other data analysis features through an HTML Widget. The library supports CSV and JSON data. __Note that this is a free version of the WebDataRocks JavaScript library, as such the data file uploaded should not exceed 1MB)__. Nonetheless, that's fair for most modeste data sets  


You can install the development version of `pivta` from Github using: 


```{r, eval=FALSE}

# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/pivta")


```



# How to use pivta

Just run `pivot()` and start playing ! The function has three main arguments:

+ _source_: Optional. Allows you to specify ex-ante the location of the csv/json data frame, by providing a URL. 
+ _sep_: The CSV data frame separator. Defaults to comma (","). Will be ignored if data is JSON.
+ _report_: Optional. Allows you to specify ex-ante the location of your JSON report file (see below). 

In Shiny, you'll have to use the `pivtaOutput()` and `renderPivta()` functions.


# Examples


<hr>

Let's work with the [CSV](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/feddelegrand7/b366864aabf9653361f461cbf972d97c/raw/a62c4672f2f5824b2634a66c948e6258d7c65323/mpg.csv) file of the [mpg](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html) data frame. You can upload the file locally or specify its URL using the __source__ argument. 

When loading a CSV file, the pivot table will by default aggregate the sum of the values of the first numeric column according to the first character column that it recognizes. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(pivta)

pivta()

```

We can make some cool analysis:

You can easily change the aggregation measure. Here let's take a look at the mean:

Too many numbers after the decimal ? no worry, it's possible and easy to format the results:

You can export your results into different format :

The results can also be saved into a JSON file called __report__. If you want to retrieve the results the next time that you open your Shiny app you can either upload it locally or store it remotely and provide a URL that points to the report (within the __report__ argument of the `pivta()` function). 



Below an example of the usage of `pivta()` on Shiny:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(pivta)
library(ggplot2)

ui <- fluidPage(

    h1("The Pivot Table"), 
    
    pivtaOutput(outputId = "pivot_table"),
    
    h1("The Plot"),
    
    plotOutput(outputId = "plt1")

)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  
  
output$pivot_table <- renderPivta({
  
  
  pivta(dsource =  "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/feddelegrand7/b366864aabf9653361f461cbf972d97c/raw/a62c4672f2f5824b2634a66c948e6258d7c65323/mpg.csv")
  
  
})  
  
output$plt1 <- renderPlot({
  
  
  ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
    geom_point(col = "#324C63")
  
})
  
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```
